# ML-Titanic

This is a Jupyter Notebook performing some data science functions on Kaggle's Titanic dataset as well as an implementation of various machine learning models such as Logistic regression, Neural networks and K-Nearest neighbors using the SkLearn package. Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib were also used.

This is only the practical part of a paper I wrote looking for an effective machine learning algorithm to employ on the Titanic dataset.
